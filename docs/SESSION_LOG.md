## Session — 2026-07-20

**Worked on:** Understanding M2 Auth (GitHub OAuth + session cookies) — Q&A only, no code changed.
**Done:**
- Walked the full login flow end to end: `/auth/login` → GitHub → `/auth/callback` → `get_current_user`.
- Clarified where things live: signed `user_id` in the session cookie (browser) vs. Fernet-encrypted `access_token` in the `users` table (Postgres) vs. `token_encryption_key` (`.env`, never in the DB).
- Clarified `access_token` is re-fetched and overwritten on every login (no "already have a token, skip OAuth" shortcut) — code exchange always happens, session cookie is what actually lets you skip re-login.
- Clarified `decrypt_token` is a read (safe/repeatable), not consume-once — same encrypted row gets decrypted fresh for every future repo-import operation; only the plaintext copy in memory is transient.
**In progress:** Nothing code-wise. Frontend (`web/src/App.tsx`) is still the default Vite scaffold — no login button, no `/me` call wired up yet.
**Key decisions:** None made this session — explanatory only.
**Next step:** Wire the frontend login button + `/me` check, or move on to Milestone 3 (Import + clone).
**Watch out for:** Session cookie has no explicit `max_age`/`https_only`/`same_site` set in `main.py` yet — worth revisiting before any deploy. `decrypt_token` still has zero callers in the codebase (expected — repo-import isn't built yet).

## Session — 2026-07-21

**Worked on:** Milestone 3 (Import + clone) — containers up, `Repository` model + migration, import endpoint. Clone itself not started.
**Done:**
- Ran `docker compose up -d --build` — all four services (`db`, `redis`, `api`, `worker`) confirmed healthy.
- Added `Repository` model + `RepositoryStatus` enum to `core/models.py`; generated and applied Alembic migration `002ecfb88441_add_repository_model`.
- Moved `worker/celery_app.py` → `core/celery_app.py` (Celery app config is shared producer/consumer infra, not worker-owned business logic); updated `docker-compose.yml`'s worker command accordingly.
- Added `parse_repo_slug()` + URL regex to `core/github.py`.
- Built `POST /api/v1/repos` (`api/repos.py`), registered in `main.py`: validates URL, blocks duplicate imports (409), inserts a `queued` `Repository` row, publishes `worker.tasks.clone_repository` via `celery_app.send_task(...)` (by name — `api` never imports `worker`).
- Verified end-to-end with a forged session cookie (signed locally with `itsdangerous`, no browser login needed): 401 unauthenticated, 422 bad URL, 201 success, 409 on repeat, row lands in Postgres as `QUEUED`, Celery message correctly published and routed to the worker (which rejected it as expected — task not defined yet).
**In progress:** `worker/tasks.py` — the actual `clone_repository` Celery task doesn't exist yet. Plan (discussed, not yet built): `git clone` authenticated via `-c http.extraHeader=...` (never embed the token in the URL — it'd persist into `.git/config`).
**Key decisions:**
- `status` is a native Postgres `ENUM`, not a plain string — DB-level rejection of invalid states.
- No `is_private` field on `Repository` — every clone will use the owning user's decrypted OAuth token regardless of visibility (an authenticated clone works fine on public repos too), so no branch/extra GitHub API call needed.
- `celery_app` lives in `core/` so both `api` (producer) and `worker` (consumer) can import it without `api` reaching into `worker`.
**Next step:** Build `worker/tasks.py::clone_repository` — clone into `/data/repos/{id}` using `http.extraHeader` token injection, update `status` through `cloning → ready|failed`, write `error_message` on failure.
**Watch out for:** Nothing blocking. The forged-cookie test trick (sign `{"user_id": ...}` with `itsdangerous.TimestampSigner` using `session_secret`) is handy for future endpoint testing without repeating the browser OAuth flow.
